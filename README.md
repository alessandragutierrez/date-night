# Date Night

A web application to plan and document date nights.

## Motive

The intention behind Date Night was rather simple... my bullet point list of ideas in my Apple Notes was just not cutting it anymore. I thought to myself, "How can I build an application that takes this list, and turns it into something comprehensive and long lasting?", and in came the objective for Date Night! 

Date Night allows the user to not only create ideas for dates, but also helps make them a reality by including functionality to set a time and place. Consequently, the dates are saved and stored, giving the user a convenient space to cherish their memories. 

My hope for Date Night is that it can, through the power and practicality of this digital age, help bring people together more even in the midst of the busy lives many of us lead.
